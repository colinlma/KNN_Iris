This is a mini project in python 2.7 I took on to get some hands on experience with a fundamental algorithm for machine learning, KNN. This is specifically designed for the iris data set. Before reading about what K to use I wanted to see for myself how different K's affect the accuracy.

To run the script make sure you have the iris data in the same folder as KNN_iris.py
You can download the dataset here:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris

KNN_Iris.py takes 3 arguments:
The number of test cases to be run for each K.
The starting K
The ending K

The script runs the algorithm on starting K to ending K (inclusive)
and prints out the accuracy of the results in decreasing accuracy.

Things to work on for the future:
Normalize the data points to improve accuracy
Try different distances such as the Manhattan distance or vector dot product
